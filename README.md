## ❌ Still to Cover (Must-Learn Topics)

## Category         | Topic                                                | Why It’s Important                                     |
* [ ]  - | - |  |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | Code Reusability via Page Object Model (POM) | Modular, scalable structure                            |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | Custom Helpers/Utils                             | Centralized common logic (e.g., login steps)           |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | Fixtures                                         | Share setup/teardown logic across tests                |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | Environment Configs                              | For running against dev/staging/prod                   |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | API Testing with Playwright                      | Use `request` context to test APIs                     |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Recommended] | Authentication via Storage State                 | To avoid login steps in every test                     |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Optional]    | Visual Testing (Screenshot comparison)           | UI regression detection                                |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Optional]    | Mocking API responses                            | Using `page.route()` to simulate API failures or stubs |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Optional]    | Test tagging & filtering                         | Run only certain tests by tag                          |
* [ ]  ✅ \[Optional]    | Parallel Projects Setup                          | Run multiple browser/device tests together             |



## 🧱 Code Reusability Techniques in Playwright (TypeScript)

## Reusability Method          | Description                                       | Example                                   |
* [ ]   | - | -- |
* [ ]  Page Object Model (POM) | Create classes for pages/components               | `loginPage.login(username, pass)`         |
* [ ]  Custom commands/utils   | Common actions like `login()`, `fillForm()`       | Stored in `utils.ts`                      |
* [ ]  Fixtures                | Share context (e.g., logged-in state, data setup) | `test.extend({ userSession })`            |
* [ ]  Environment variables   | Use `.env` for dynamic base URLs, credentials     | `process.env.BASE_URL`                    |
* [ ]  Storage State           | Reuse logged-in session                           | `test.use({ storageState: 'auth.json' })` |



## ✅ Suggested Folder Structure for Practice

* [ ] tests/
│
├── login.spec.ts
├── dashboard.spec.ts
│

* [ ] pages/
├── login.page.ts
├── dashboard.page.ts
│

* [ ] utils/
├── helpers.ts
├── testData.ts
│
fixtures/
├── setup.ts
│
playwright.config.ts


## ✅ Final Checklist Before You Start Practicing

* [ ] Basic Playwright test setup
* [ ] Created 2–3 sample test cases
* [ ] Page Object Model for at least one page
* [ ] Reusable login function
* [ ] Global setup file for auth or session
* [ ] Debug with Trace Viewer
* [ ] Configured CI or at least tried running via CLI
* [ ] Explored device/browser variations
* [ ] Tagged and grouped test scenarios
